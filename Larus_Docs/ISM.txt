Sub:New NOON report format
Attn:Mr Theopoulos 


As discussed  pls find attached  excel with the complete  data and values.  

Standard ISM report will be auto generated and will come to office as text as always , without any change , but the NOON values reported will be also auto -input in our new monitoring excel.

Pls update  the values as per our discussion today and when ready , we'll speak about the details of  limitations and auto - alarm modes , appearing to office program , for excessive reported values in the new NOON report .

This function , is planned to be  in line with the set / expected  values , either in  cooperation of  ECON  ( monitoring and forecast)  function that has  been developed already , or by manually set values of alarm limitations as per normal practice. (for daily FW consumptions etc) 

Thus , program will not only control and monitor all daily reported values of the fleet , but also will give alarm / notify to oper/tech if any values are excessively higher than normally expected.

Finally, even though in essence is much more easy for the crew to fill up the new format of NOON and generate the standard ISM NOON report , is better to prepare a brief manual with few instructions before we release anything to vessels. 

When completed , we'll discuss all together in larus  to decide to release it to vessels.
